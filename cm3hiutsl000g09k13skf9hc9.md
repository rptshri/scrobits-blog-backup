### **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

Now, let’s tackle those frustrating issues that come up unexpectedly.

Network latency is a common culprit that can stop your replication dead in its tracks. Ensure proper network setups and consider a dedicated Direct Connect or VPN for smoother data flow.

Security groups and routing tables are more crucial than you might think. They're like locking your front door—simple but key to seamless connectivity!

Data transformation errors can throw off your data structure. Use DMS transformation rules carefully and always double-check these settings.

AWS performance logs are lifesavers, pinpointing mishaps and helping you resolve issues swiftly.
